# Invite-Scanner
A little java program that scans for discord invites. Definitely not the best, but it works.

## Important

**Reminder: This program was made for educational purposes! Use at your own risk!**

Since the program scans by requesting Discord's website, do not set the delay too low, or else it might Dos the website or crash your router!

## Usage

Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://) and open the program. Set your settings for the scan and confirm. The program will now start scanning.
